# 🍷 Decision Tree – Wine Dataset EDA

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and a **Decision Tree–based feature analysis** on the Wine dataset.  
The goal of this project is to understand the data, analyze feature–target relationships, and interpret feature importance using a Decision Tree model.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Perform structured **EDA** on the Wine dataset  
- Visualize **feature vs target** relationships  
- Understand how **Decision Trees split data**
- Identify **important features** using model-based methods

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **Name:** Wine Dataset  
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Type:** Structured tabular data  
- **Target:** Wine class / quality (classification)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process includes:
- Dataset overview and shape
- Checking missing values
- Statistical summary of features
- Distribution plots
- Feature vs target visualizations
- Correlation analysis

The EDA is **inspired by a GeeksforGeeks tutorial** and has been **adapted and extended** with explanations and decision-tree-based insights for learning purposes.

---

## 🌳 Decision Tree Analysis
- Trained a Decision Tree model on the dataset
- Analyzed how features contribute to predictions
- Visualized **feature importance** to identify the most influential variables
- Used model insights to support EDA findings

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Certain chemical properties strongly influence wine classification
- Decision Trees provide interpretable feature importance
- EDA + model-based analysis improves understanding of data behavior
